But to build this package `babel-plugin-add-module-exports` is used ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports).\n  Which result in both `module.exports` and `exports.default`

set.\n  See https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23645 for example of it.\n  \n  Instead of adding same babel plugin we mimic output here.
