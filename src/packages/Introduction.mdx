# Introduction

R•K•TA is a work-in-progress design system that follows MUI concepts but has a different technical implementation.

We wrote it in typescript and styled it with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

You can use R•K•TA [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) frameworks for creating responsive web applications.
